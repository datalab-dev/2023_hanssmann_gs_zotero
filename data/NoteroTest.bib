Through an analysis of blog posts and comment threads written in response to the conference proceedings, I find that participants in the feminist counterpublic of birth advocacy utilize three primary strategies: they redefine {VBAC} as “just birth” rather than a medical “procedure;” they recontextualize the biomedical use of “risk” to include other factors outside of the immediate context of the hospital; and they reframe {VBAC} as a right rather than a preference. Together, these strategies work together to demonstrate the incommensurability of “shared doctor–patient decision making” within the current biomedical model of care. This move, toward a rights-based framework within a more highly contextualized systemic critique of health care, positions {VBAC} to be an issue that could link birth advocacy to a larger feminist health justice movement.},

	abstract = {Policy Points This article reconceptualizes our understanding of the opioid epidemic and proposes six strategies that address the epidemic's social roots. In order to successfully reduce drug-related mortality over the long term, policymakers and public health leaders should develop partnerships with people who use drugs, incorporate harm reduction interventions, and reverse decades of drug criminalization policies.
{CONTEXT}: Drug overdose is the leading cause of injury-related death in the United States. Synthetic opioids, predominantly illicit fentanyl and its analogs, surpassed prescription opioids and heroin in associated mortality rates in 2016. Unfortunately, interventions fail to fully address the current wave of the opioid epidemic and often omit the voices of people with lived experiences regarding drug use. Every overdose death is a culmination of a long series of policy failures and lost opportunities for harm reduction.
{METHODS}: In this article, we conducted a scoping review of the opioid literature to propose a novel framework designed to foreground social determinants more directly into our understanding of this national emergency. The "continuum of overdose risk" framework is our synthesis of the global evidence base and is grounded in contemporary theories, models, and policies that have been successfully applied both domestically and internationally.
{FINDINGS}: De-escalating overdose risk in the long term will require scaling up innovative and comprehensive solutions that have been designed through partnerships with people who use drugs and are rooted in harm reduction.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Without recognizing the full drug-use continuum and the role of social determinants, the current responses to drug overdose will continue to aggravate the problem they are trying to solve.},

This is only the most recent incarnation of the fear of fat black women, which Sabrina Strings shows took root more than two hundred years ago.Strings weaves together an eye-opening historical narrative ranging from the Renaissance to the current moment, analyzing important works of art, newspaper and magazine articles, and scientific literature and medical journals―where fat bodies were once praised―showing that fat phobia, as it relates to black women, did not originate with medical findings, but with the Enlightenment era belief that fatness was evidence of “savagery” and racial inferiority. The author argues that the contemporary ideal of slenderness is, at its very core, racialized and racist. Indeed, it was not until the early twentieth century, when racialized attitudes against fatness were already entrenched in the culture, that the medical establishment began its crusade against obesity. An important and original work, Fearing the Black Body argues convincingly that fat phobia isn’t about health at all, but rather a means of using the body to validate race, class, and gender prejudice.},

	abstract = {{AIMS}: Several decades of research have shown that lesbian, gay and bisexual ({LGB}) adults are at high risk for substance use and substance use disorders ({SUDs}). These problems may often start prior to young adulthood; however, relatively little is known about risk for substance use in {LGB} adolescents. The primary aims of this paper were to conduct a meta-analysis of the relationship between sexual orientation and adolescent substance use and a systematic review and critique of the methodological characteristics of this literature.
{METHODS}: Medical and social science journals were searched using Medline and {PsychInfo}. Studies were included if they tested the relationship between sexual orientation and adolescent substance use. Eighteen published studies were identified. Data analysis procedures followed expert guidelines, and used National Institutes of Health ({NIH})-sponsored meta-analysis software.
{RESULTS}: {LGB} adolescents reported higher rates of substance use compared to heterosexual youth (overall odds ratio = 2.89, Cohen's d = 0.59). Effect sizes varied by gender, bisexuality status, sexual orientation definition and recruitment source. None of the studies tested mediation and only one tested moderation. One employed a matched comparison group design, one used a longitudinal design, and very few controlled for possible confounding variables.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The odds of substance use for {LGB} youth were, on average, 190\% higher than for heterosexual youth and substantially higher within some subpopulations of {LGB} youth (340\% higher for bisexual youth, 400\% higher for females). Causal mechanisms, protective factors and alternative explanations for this effect, as well as long-term substance use outcomes in {LGB} youth, remain largely unknown.},

The Youth Risk Behavior Survey ({YRBS}) is conducted biennially among local, state, and nationally representative samples of U.S. high school students in grades 9-12. In 2017, 10 states (Colorado, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Rhode Island, Vermont, Wisconsin) and nine large urban school districts (Boston, Broward County, Cleveland, Detroit, District of Columbia, Los Angeles, New York City, San Diego, San Francisco) piloted a measure of transgender identity. Using pooled data from these 19 sites, the prevalence of transgender identity was assessed, and relationships between transgender identity and violence victimization, substance use, suicide risk, and sexual risk behaviors were evaluated using logistic regression. Compared with cisgender males and cisgender females, transgender students were more likely to report violence victimization, substance use, and suicide risk, and, although more likely to report some sexual risk behaviors, were also more likely to be tested for human immunodeficiency virus ({HIV}) infection.

The field has identified 2 distinct determinants of this risk, including group-specific minority stressors and general psychological processes that are common across sexual orientations. The goal of the present article is to develop a theoretical framework that integrates the important insights from these literatures. The framework postulates that (a) sexual minorities confront increased stress exposure resulting from stigma; (b) this stigma-related stress creates elevations in general emotion dysregulation, social/interpersonal problems, and cognitive processes conferring risk for psychopathology; and (c) these processes in turn mediate the relationship between stigma-related stress and psychopathology. It is argued that this framework can, theoretically, illuminate how stigma adversely affects mental health and, practically, inform clinical interventions. Evidence for the predictive validity of this framework is reviewed, with particular attention paid to illustrative examples from research on depression, anxiety, and alcohol-use disorders.},

They were also more likely than heterosexual, non-transgendered youth to report suicidal ideation (30\% vs. 6\%, p {\textless} 0.0001) and self-harm (21\% vs. 6\%, p {\textless} 0.0001). Mediation analyses showed that perceived discrimination accounted for increased depressive symptomatology among {LGBT} males and females, and accounted for an elevated risk of self-harm and suicidal ideation among {LGBT} males. Perceived discrimination is a likely contributor to emotional distress among {LGBT} youth.},

These inequities are the impetus for ongoing efforts in academic medicine to create inclusive educational and patient care environments for diverse stakeholders. Frequently, approaches focus on singular populations or broad macroscopic concepts and do not always elucidate the complexities that arise at the intersection between multiple identities and life experiences. Intersectionality acknowledges multidimensional aspects of identity inclusive of historical, structural, and cultural factors. Understanding how multiple identity experiences impact different individuals, from patients to trainees to providers, is critical for improving health care education and delivery. Building on existing work within academic medicine, this Commentary outlines six key recommendations to advance intersectionality in academic medicine: embrace personal and collective loci of responsibility; examine and rectify unbalanced power dynamics; celebrate visibility and intersectional innovation; engage all stakeholders in the process of change; select and analyze meaningful metrics; and sustain the commitment to achieving health equity over time. Members of the academic medical community committed to advancing health equity can use these recommendations to promote and maintain meaningful changes that recognize and respond to the multidimensional voices and expressed needs of all individuals engaged in providing and receiving health care.},

While there is economic diversity within the {LGBTQ}-parent community, research across these four measures consistently shows that {LGBTQ}-parent families report lower overall household incomes, higher rates of poverty, increased food insecurity, and greater receipt of public assistance than both non-{LGBTQ} parents and their families and {LGBTQ} people who are not parents.

Research into the value of health insurance coverage for gender-affirming care for transgender individuals shows that the health benefits far outweigh the costs of insuring transition procedures.

Through an analysis of blog posts and comment threads written in response to the conference proceedings, I find that participants in the feminist counterpublic of birth advocacy utilize three primary strategies: they redefine {VBAC} as “just birth” rather than a medical “procedure;” they recontextualize the biomedical use of “risk” to include other factors outside of the immediate context of the hospital; and they reframe {VBAC} as a right rather than a preference. Together, these strategies work together to demonstrate the incommensurability of “shared doctor–patient decision making” within the current biomedical model of care. This move, toward a rights-based framework within a more highly contextualized systemic critique of health care, positions {VBAC} to be an issue that could link birth advocacy to a larger feminist health justice movement.},

In order to successfully reduce drug-related mortality over the long term, policymakers and public health leaders should develop partnerships with people who use drugs, incorporate harm reduction interventions, and reverse decades of drug criminalization policies.
{CONTEXT}: Drug overdose is the leading cause of injury-related death in the United States. Synthetic opioids, predominantly illicit fentanyl and its analogs, surpassed prescription opioids and heroin in associated mortality rates in 2016. Unfortunately, interventions fail to fully address the current wave of the opioid epidemic and often omit the voices of people with lived experiences regarding drug use. Every overdose death is a culmination of a long series of policy failures and lost opportunities for harm reduction.
{METHODS}: In this article, we conducted a scoping review of the opioid literature to propose a novel framework designed to foreground social determinants more directly into our understanding of this national emergency. The "continuum of overdose risk" framework is our synthesis of the global evidence base and is grounded in contemporary theories, models, and policies that have been successfully applied both domestically and internationally.
{FINDINGS}: De-escalating overdose risk in the long term will require scaling up innovative and comprehensive solutions that have been designed through partnerships with people who use drugs and are rooted in harm reduction.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Without recognizing the full drug-use continuum and the role of social determinants, the current responses to drug overdose will continue to aggravate the problem they are trying to solve.},

This is only the most recent incarnation of the fear of fat black women, which Sabrina Strings shows took root more than two hundred years ago.Strings weaves together an eye-opening historical narrative ranging from the Renaissance to the current moment, analyzing important works of art, newspaper and magazine articles, and scientific literature and medical journals―where fat bodies were once praised―showing that fat phobia, as it relates to black women, did not originate with medical findings, but with the Enlightenment era belief that fatness was evidence of “savagery” and racial inferiority. The author argues that the contemporary ideal of slenderness is, at its very core, racialized and racist. Indeed, it was not until the early twentieth century, when racialized attitudes against fatness were already entrenched in the culture, that the medical establishment began its crusade against obesity. An important and original work, Fearing the Black Body argues convincingly that fat phobia isn’t about health at all, but rather a means of using the body to validate race, class, and gender prejudice.},

	abstract = {{AIMS}: Several decades of research have shown that lesbian, gay and bisexual ({LGB}) adults are at high risk for substance use and substance use disorders ({SUDs}). These problems may often start prior to young adulthood; however, relatively little is known about risk for substance use in {LGB} adolescents. The primary aims of this paper were to conduct a meta-analysis of the relationship between sexual orientation and adolescent substance use and a systematic review and critique of the methodological characteristics of this literature.
{METHODS}: Medical and social science journals were searched using Medline and {PsychInfo}. Studies were included if they tested the relationship between sexual orientation and adolescent substance use. Eighteen published studies were identified. Data analysis procedures followed expert guidelines, and used National Institutes of Health ({NIH})-sponsored meta-analysis software.
{RESULTS}: {LGB} adolescents reported higher rates of substance use compared to heterosexual youth (overall odds ratio = 2.89, Cohen's d = 0.59). Effect sizes varied by gender, bisexuality status, sexual orientation definition and recruitment source. None of the studies tested mediation and only one tested moderation. One employed a matched comparison group design, one used a longitudinal design, and very few controlled for possible confounding variables.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The odds of substance use for {LGB} youth were, on average, 190\% higher than for heterosexual youth and substantially higher within some subpopulations of {LGB} youth (340\% higher for bisexual youth, 400\% higher for females). Causal mechanisms, protective factors and alternative explanations for this effect, as well as long-term substance use outcomes in {LGB} youth, remain largely unknown.},

Yet few large-scale assessments of these disparities among high school students exist. The Youth Risk Behavior Survey ({YRBS}) is conducted biennially among local, state, and nationally representative samples of U.S. high school students in grades 9-12. In 2017, 10 states (Colorado, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Rhode Island, Vermont, Wisconsin) and nine large urban school districts (Boston, Broward County, Cleveland, Detroit, District of Columbia, Los Angeles, New York City, San Diego, San Francisco) piloted a measure of transgender identity. Using pooled data from these 19 sites, the prevalence of transgender identity was assessed, and relationships between transgender identity and violence victimization, substance use, suicide risk, and sexual risk behaviors were evaluated using logistic regression. Compared with cisgender males and cisgender females, transgender students were more likely to report violence victimization, substance use, and suicide risk, and, although more likely to report some sexual risk behaviors, were also more likely to be tested for human immunodeficiency virus ({HIV}) infection. These findings indicate a need for intervention efforts to improve health outcomes among transgender youths.},

	abstract = {Sexual minorities are at increased risk for multiple mental health burdens compared with heterosexuals. The field has identified 2 distinct determinants of this risk, including group-specific minority stressors and general psychological processes that are common across sexual orientations. The goal of the present article is to develop a theoretical framework that integrates the important insights from these literatures. The framework postulates that (a) sexual minorities confront increased stress exposure resulting from stigma; (b) this stigma-related stress creates elevations in general emotion dysregulation, social/interpersonal problems, and cognitive processes conferring risk for psychopathology; and (c) these processes in turn mediate the relationship between stigma-related stress and psychopathology. It is argued that this framework can, theoretically, illuminate how stigma adversely affects mental health and, practically, inform clinical interventions. Evidence for the predictive validity of this framework is reviewed, with particular attention paid to illustrative examples from research on depression, anxiety, and alcohol-use disorders.},

Data come from a school-based survey in Boston, Massachusetts (n = 1,032); 10\% were {LGBT}, 58\% were female, and ages ranged from 13 to 19 years. About 45\% were Black, 31\% were Hispanic, and 14\% were White. {LGBT} youth scored significantly higher on the scale of depressive symptomatology. They were also more likely than heterosexual, non-transgendered youth to report suicidal ideation (30\% vs. 6\%, p {\textless} 0.0001) and self-harm (21\% vs. 6\%, p {\textless} 0.0001). Mediation analyses showed that perceived discrimination accounted for increased depressive symptomatology among {LGBT} males and females, and accounted for an elevated risk of self-harm and suicidal ideation among {LGBT} males. Perceived discrimination is a likely contributor to emotional distress among {LGBT} youth.},

	abstract = {Recent societal events highlight inequities experienced by underrepresented and marginalized communities. These inequities are the impetus for ongoing efforts in academic medicine to create inclusive educational and patient care environments for diverse stakeholders. Frequently, approaches focus on singular populations or broad macroscopic concepts and do not always elucidate the complexities that arise at the intersection between multiple identities and life experiences. Intersectionality acknowledges multidimensional aspects of identity inclusive of historical, structural, and cultural factors. Understanding how multiple identity experiences impact different individuals, from patients to trainees to providers, is critical for improving health care education and delivery. Building on existing work within academic medicine, this Commentary outlines six key recommendations to advance intersectionality in academic medicine: embrace personal and collective loci of responsibility; examine and rectify unbalanced power dynamics; celebrate visibility and intersectional innovation; engage all stakeholders in the process of change; select and analyze meaningful metrics; and sustain the commitment to achieving health equity over time. Members of the academic medical community committed to advancing health equity can use these recommendations to promote and maintain meaningful changes that recognize and respond to the multidimensional voices and expressed needs of all individuals engaged in providing and receiving health care.},

While there is economic diversity within the {LGBTQ}-parent community, research across these four measures consistently shows that {LGBTQ}-parent families report lower overall household incomes, higher rates of poverty, increased food insecurity, and greater receipt of public assistance than both non-{LGBTQ} parents and their families and {LGBTQ} people who are not parents. The chapter also reviews potential reasons for these consistent findings and offers directions for future research that are crucial for ensuring that {LGBTQ}-parent families can thrive.},
