# FJHC Gender Studies Zotero Project

This repository contains code for the Feminist Health Justice Collective's 
Zotero project. The project involves migrating citation data for health 
resources from a Notion database to a Zotero database for management and storage.
Once this is complete, FHJC will be able to add data to their database using 
Zotero's browser plugins, and will have an easy way to export their data for 
backup. Then the [Notero Plugin][notero] will be used to port the data into 
a Notion database, which will connect to the FHJC website.

Because some of the resources (particularly the podcasts) required significant
reformatting to be compatible with bibtex syntax, rerunning this code as is at
a later date will most likely not work, especially if more podcasts have been
added. If you need to redo the data-crosswalk for some reason, the two functions
that will require the most changes to work properly are `format_title()` and
`format_authors()`. There may be others but those were the ones that caused the 
most issues originally. Additionally, there is a list of all the organizations
used as authors in the database that will also need to be updated (line 189).

## File and Directory Structure

The directory structure for the project is:

```
README.md
data/         Data sets (files > 1MB go on Google Drive)
src/          python code
```

## Process Notion CSV Export

“Resource Name” Column is the key. It will be the title in the Zotero database.

1. Export data from Notion database as CSV (make note of the date this was done)
2. Split Structural Framework by comma
3. Determine Item Type based on Resource Type (primer will have to be collapsed)
4. Extract Author list from Authors column
5. Get URL from Links column
6. Get tags list from Topics Column
7. Parse out Full Citation to extract (as available):
    * Date and Year
    * Journal, volume and issue
    * Series Name
    * Publisher
    * Editor
    * Location/Place
9. Create a BibLatex entry for each resource using the data you previously extracted
   * Tags should include all of the Resource’s topics as well as “notion”
   * Create a list of resources for each Structural Framework
10. Write a .bib file for each Structural Framework containing the BibLatex 
entries for each resource in that framework.
