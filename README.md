# FJHC Gender Studies Zotero Project

This repository contains code for the Feminist Health Justice Collective's Zotero project. The
project involves migrating citation data for health resources from a Notion database to a Zotero 
database for management and storage. Once this is complete, FHJC will be able to add data to their
database using Zotero's browser plugins, and will have an easy way to export their data for backup.

## Process Notion CSV Export

“Resource Name” Column is the key. It will be the title in the Zotero database

1. Export data from Notion database as CSV (make note of the date this was done)
2. Split Structural Framework by comma
3. Determine Item Type based on Resource Type (primer will have to be collapsed)
4. Extract Author list from Authors column
5. Get URL from Links column
6. Get tags list from Topics Column
7. Parse out Full Citation to extract (as available):
    a. Date and Year
    a. Journal, volume and issue
    c. Series Name
    d. Publisher
    e. Editor
    f. Location/Place
9. Create a BibLatex entry for each resource using the data you previously extracted
   a. Tags should include all of the Resource’s topics as well as “notion”
   b. Create a list of resources for each Structural Framework
10. Write a .bib file for each Structural Framework containing the BibLatex entries for each resource in that framework.
