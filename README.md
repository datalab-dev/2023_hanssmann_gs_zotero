# FJHC Gender Studies Zotero Project

This repository contains code for the Feminist Health Justice Collective's Zotero project. The
project involves migrating citation data for health resources from a Notion database to a Zotero 
database for management and storage. Once this is complete, FHJC will be able to add data to their
database using Zotero's browser plugins, and will have an easy way to export their data for backup.
